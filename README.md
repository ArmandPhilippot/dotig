# Dotig

A dotfiles manager to quickly setup your machine & synchronize your dotfiles.

## Description

Dotig stands for [S]tow + [dot]files + G[it]. I admit, it's not the easiest name to pronounce. But, I wanted a short name (no more than 6 characters) to avoid creating an alias. I also wanted a name not used: "dotman" is common, "dotit" is used by other tech companies ...


## Requirements

Dotig needs:
* Git
* GNU Stow

If you want to backup your dotfiles, and since you're here, I assume Git is not a problem. Regarding GNU Stow, I think it makes symlinks easier.

## Install

Download `dotig.sh`.

## Usage

## Configuration

To store your dotfiles path, Dotig use an environnement variable.
